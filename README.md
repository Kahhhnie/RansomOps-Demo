## Overview

In this educational simulation, we explore a real-world scenario where a victim unknowingly downloads malware disguised as legitimate software from a phishing website. Once installed, the malware encrypts the victim's files, rendering them inaccessible and leaving the victim at the mercy of attackers.

---
## Features

- **Phishing Simulation**: Demonstrates how attackers use phishing techniques to deliver malicious software.
- **Ransomware Execution**: Shows the encryption of victim files to simulate a ransomware attack.
- **Educational Focus**:  Highlights prevention strategies and raises awareness of cybersecurity risks.
- **Environment Isolation**: Runs in a controlled setup using virtual machines for safety.

---
## Environment Setup 

- **Attackerâ€™s Setup**:  
  - Operating System: Kali Linux (used for launching attacks and monitoring the victimâ€™s machine).  

- **Victimâ€™s Setup**:  
  - Operating System: Windows running in VMware. 




## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)

## Installation

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd RansomOps-Demo
`````

### Step 2: Configure Virtual Machines
- Set up Kali Linux and Windows virtual machines in VMware.
- Assign network configurations (e.g., NAT or Bridged) to ensure connectivity between the attacker and victim machines.

### Step 3:  Set Up Phishing Website
On the Kali Linux machine:
1. Install Apache:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 -y
`````
2. Host the phishing webpage in `/var/www/html`.

### Step 4: Deploy Ransomware Payload
- Prepare the ransomware payload and ensure it is accessible through the phishing site.

### Step 5: Test the Setup
- Verify that the victim can access the phishing site and download the payload.

- Simulate the attack and observe the ransomware execution.


## Usage
### Running the Simulation
1. Launch both the attacker and victim virtual machines.
2. Access the phishing site from the victimâ€™s browser.
3. Download and execute the ransomware payload on the victim machine.
4. Observe the file encryption and ransomware behavior.

### Post-Attack Analysis
- Review the attack logs on the Kali Linux machine.
- Discuss mitigation strategies and prevention methods.

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
- Phishing Site Not Accessible: Ensure Apache is running and network settings are configured correctly.
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
`````


- **VMware Network Issues**: Check that both virtual machines are on the same network type (NAT/Bridged).

- **Payload Not Executing**: Verify that the payload is compatible with the victimâ€™s OS and that any required dependencies are present.


## Clean Up
To safely clean up the demo:
1. Shut down and delete the victim and attacker virtual machines.
2. Remove any residual files from the host system.
3. Reset network configurations if modified.
